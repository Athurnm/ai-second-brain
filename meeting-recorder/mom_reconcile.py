"""Reconcile Fathom recordings against MOM files, and alarm on the gap.

Why this exists
---------------
Every other part of the meeting pipeline is capture-artifact-driven: the
watcher loops over .wav files that appeared, and the Vexa dispatcher fires a
bot and never looks back. Both are structurally blind to the meetings they
missed, because an empty recordings dir is indistinguishable from a day with
no meetings. On 16 Jul 2026 that dropped YourManager's mandatory Product/Growth/PMO
weekly (62 min, 12 decisions) while vexa-auto logged 19 "ok" heartbeats.

This script inverts the question. Instead of "an artifact appeared, what do I
do with it?" it asks "a meeting happened, where is its MOM?" and it asks it
against Fathom, the only record of what happened that this harness does not
produce itself. It fires on ABSENCE, which nothing else here can do.

The day is enumerated from LIVE Fathom, not from the local registry. The
registry (journal/fathom_registry.json) is a downstream artifact written only
by the evening sync, so mid-day it holds zero rows for today and the checker
went blind. We now query Fathom directly for the day and keep the registry
purely as an enrichment cache (matched_meeting title, related_recordings,
mom_path backlinks). If live Fathom is unreachable we mark the run
non-authoritative and exit 2 rather than reporting a false clean day.

Coverage for a Fathom recording resolves in this order:
  1. its own mom_path exists on disk
  2. any related_recordings entry has a mom_path on disk
  3. any registry row sharing date_wib + matched_meeting has a mom_path
     (Fathom / Vexa / local all land in the registry, so this is the dedupe key)
  4. a MOM_<Title>_<date>.md filed under Clients/Work/**/meetings/ fuzzy-matches

A MOM that exists but is tiny, or is filed under a non-meeting calendar block,
counts as SUSPECT rather than covered: a false-positive MOM reads as done and
hides the miss, which is worse than an outright gap. A recording that ended
less than the grace window ago has legitimately not been minuted yet and is
bucketed as PENDING, which does NOT trip the gap alarm.

Usage:
  python3 meeting-recorder/mom_reconcile.py [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--quiet]
Exit codes: 0 = fully covered, 1 = gaps found, 2 = could not run / verify.
